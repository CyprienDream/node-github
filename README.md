This is my first project using Nodejs, TypeScript and React. The main functionality is to display user information as well as the list of public repositories of the github account corresponding to the user input.It also contains a filtering functionality to browse through the repositories. It retrieves the necessary data using the GitHub api.

This app has been deployed on Heroku: https://thegithub-lookup.herokuapp.com/

Run the project locally: npm start

TO DO:

  - write test suit
  - make api request asynchronous to fix displaying issue when waiting for response
